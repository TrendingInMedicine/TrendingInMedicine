RAKE
====

Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) Algorithm implemented in Python3 and uses parts of NLTK. It singularizes words, uses cosine similarity to check if two phrases are alike, and replaces acronyms with their full phrases. It was specifically adapted for parsing medical journals, but can be used for any other large sums of text.

Based off of the implementation described by Rose, S., Engel, D., Cramer, N., & Cowley, W. (2010) and  http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2013/03/implementing-rake-algorithm-with-nltk.html
